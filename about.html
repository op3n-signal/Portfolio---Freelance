                        <p>I currently work as a professional web developer building websites, and I also offer my services independently so I can work more closely with clients, understand their goals directly, and offer solutions that truly fit their needs.</p>
                        <p>I truly believe in helping each other as a community and I don't believe in taking advantage of anyone. I will build you a website if you truly need that, but if your issue is something that can be done on your own or with little guidance then I will point you in the right direction.</p> 
                        <p>I enjoy taking full ownership of projects from idea to launch, and my goal is to make sure every website is well-designed, purposeful, and genuinely helps your business grow.</p>
